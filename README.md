## Background

Skin cancer is a prevalent form of cancer, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. This project employs deep learning techniques to automate the process of identifying different types of skin cancer from dermoscopic images. The model is trained on a diverse dataset to ensure its effectiveness across various skin types and conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a curated collection of dermoscopic images representing nine different varieties of skin cancer. The dataset is properly labeled and split into training, validation, and test sets to train and assess the model's performance.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model is built using state-of-the-art architectures tailored for image classification tasks. Transfer learning is employed with a pre-trained backbone, specifically the "big transfer-for-melanoma" model, to leverage knowledge from a large dataset. The model is fine-tuned on our skin cancer dataset to adapt it to the specific characteristics of dermatoscopic images.
